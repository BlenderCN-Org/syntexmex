TODO:

- make sure when using "subdivision modifier" to put Options on "Sharp",
  because otherwise seams are going to be visible again due to the smoothing
  of UV coordinates

- increase patch size for better adherence to the patterns found
  in the example image

  
- alorithm automatically iterates over the longer of two edges and
  writes pixels from there into the face of the shorter edge
